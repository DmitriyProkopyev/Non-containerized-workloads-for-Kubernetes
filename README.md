# non-containerized-workloads-for-kubernetes
This project integrates Nomad HashiCorp with Kubernetes API to achieve native-like management of non-containerized workloads through Kubernetes. This approach addresses the issues of disk I/O performance degradation as a result of containerization, allowing to manage containerized microservices and non-containerized disk-heavy services together.
